# Air-Pollution-Code
The code from my undergraduate thesis on the contemporaneus affects of air pollution on subjective wellbeing.

I used a region fixed effects model with two instrumental variables to show the causal effect of variations in daily air pollution on subjective wellbeing.

I combined data on air pollution (from DEFRA accessed through the incredibly useful openair package), weather (from CEDA), atmospheric temperature (from NASA) and subjective wellbeing (from Understanding Society Panel).

I struglled to find any code that was similar and wished that I had been able since it would have saved me hours and hours of research and trial and error.

The main aim of creating this repository is that other people can use the code I have written. If anyone has any questions or suggestions for changes in the code please say.
